- Before I become a front-end developer... 🐈\
I worked as a designer in Tokyo, making anything from interior design to graphic design.\
I used many software products for work, including Adobe products, CAD and 3D rendering, etc.\
This made me think, "Those tools are so essential to my life. I want to make tools for people!"\
That's where I started learning web development.
